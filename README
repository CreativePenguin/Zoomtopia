Stuylib is both a toolkit and a framework for WPIlibj projects. When completed,
Stuylib will simplify user I/O, provide easy-to-use methods for developing complex
autonomous robot routines through various drive systems, and provide users with a
flexible LabVIEW dashboard that is both dynamic and robust.

***Features***
 - A Cartesian coordinate system that works with sensors and motors to control
    robot locomotion
 - Support for various drivetrain systems and methods of teleoperated control
 - A LabVIEW Dashboard that reports all sensor data, providing users with information 
    that can be analyzed later to "replay" a match from the robot's perspective
